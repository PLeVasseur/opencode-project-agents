description: Use FLS definition roles and standard library references.
compatibility: opencode

## What I do

- Explain definition roles `:t:`, `:c:`, `:s:` and definition forms `:dt:`, `:dc:`, `:ds:`
- Show prefix/suffix and label syntax for links
- Explain `:std:` for Rust standard library search links
- Resolve glossary collisions by first scanning nearby sections and similarly named terms to confirm the intended concept; if no established phrase fits, define a qualified term and keep the literal spelling with `:c:` or inline code

## When to use me

- Defining or linking FLS terms, constructs, or syntax categories
