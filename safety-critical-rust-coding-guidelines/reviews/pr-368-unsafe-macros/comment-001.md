### Comment
``fls_4vjbkm4ceymk`` is the FLS section for Attribute Macros, but this guideline and its examples are about ``macro_rules!`` declarative macros. Please align the FLS paragraph with the macro kind covered by the rule (or update the examples to attribute macros).

```suggestion
   :fls: fls_<declarative-macro-paragraph-id>
```
