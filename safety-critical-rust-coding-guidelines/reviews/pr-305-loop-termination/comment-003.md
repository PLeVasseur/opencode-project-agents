Snippet: ``All loops shall have a termination condition that can be demonstrated to be reachable``

### Type
Blocking

### Comment
The normative termination requirement and the loop-variant conditions need authoritative citations (standards or other sources). Please add citations in the amplification (not only in the rationale) so the rule can be verified.
